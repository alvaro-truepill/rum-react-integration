| fix:   	            | Patch release    	| When you make backward compatible bug fixes                 	|
| feat:  	            | Feature release  	| When you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner 	|
| BREAKING CHANGE:  	| Breaking release 	| When you make incompatible API changes                      	|

Note: You should at all time avoid breaking changes where possible.

## Why do we maintain this fork ourselves?

The fork we were using didn't work with pnpm. This fixes an issue installing the original module via `pnpm` by removing `webpack` entirely.
